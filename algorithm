Summary:
To add a user in Unix/Linux OS, the command is "useradd {username}" this should always be run by root or a sudo user.

To get the complete list of users present in the Unix/Linux OS we need to query a system file contents, the file which 
contains the entire list of users in the OS is "/etc/passwd" when we query this file using "cat /etc/passwd" we will
get the entire list of users. 

This list includes both system users and normal users, to differentiate between them, we 
can query using "grep" by checking if "bash" is present or not.

Algorithm:

a) addUser:
   
   Input: username to be added
   Processing: sudo() Fabric API is used 
   Output: If success then Done is displayed
           If failed then Aborting is displayed

   1. Run the linux command "useradd {username}" Eg: useradd skolenki1 from a sudo fabric function sudo()
   2. Success or Failure is automatically displayed by the fabric.
   3. If the user entered in the #1 is already present on the server then it errors out too.

b) findUser:

   Input: username to be found
   Processing: run() Fabric API is used 
   Output: If success then "Found user {user} on the system." is displayed to the user
           If failed then "User {user} is not on the system." is displayed to the user

   1. Run the linux command "cat /etc/passwd" from a run fabric function run()
   2. Create a empty list to store all the users from the system
   3. If we use split() to this response in step #1, then we get a list of entries, again split this entry with ":" i.e., split(":") and get the first string [0].
   4. This string will be the username which we append to a list in step #2
   5. At the end of the loop we will have a list with all the users present on the server
   6. We check if the user name provided in the function is present in this list or not
   7. If not present then we error out, if present we inform the user that his username is present

c) listUsers:
   
   Input: None
   Processing: run() Fabric API is used 
   Output: list of non system users are displayed as a list

   1. Run the linux command "cat /etc/passwd | grep bash"
   2. Create a empty list to store all the users from the system
   3. If we use split() to this response in step #1, then we get a list of entries, again split this entry with ":" i.e., split(":") and get the first string [0].
   4. This string will be the username which we append to a list in step #2
   5. At the end of the loop we will have a list with all the users present on the server
   6. In step #1, since we grep it using "bash" we get only bash users from the system which will be stored in the list we created in step #2
   7. Display this list which we created in step #2 now which displays the list of non system users present on the server.

c) listSysUsers:

   Input: None
   Processing: run() Fabric API is used 
   Output: list of system users are displayed as a list

   1. Run the linux command "cat /etc/passwd | grep -v bash"
   2. Create a empty list to store all the users from the system
   3. If we use split() to this response in step #1, then we get a list of entries, again split this entry with ":" i.e., split(":") and get the first string [0].
   4. This string will be the username which we append to a list in step #2
   5. At the end of the loop we will have a list with all the users present on the server
   6. In step #1, since we grep it using "-v bash" we get only non bash users from the system which will be stored in the list we created in step #2
   7. Display this list which we created in step #2 now which displays the list of only system users present on the server.
